<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Loop Killer</strong> respects your privacy.</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>

<h3>Data You Enter (Stored Locally)</h3>
<p>Loop Killer lets you create daily entries that may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A loop/habit you want to avoid (text)</li>
  <li>An interrupt/action you plan to use (text)</li>
  <li>Your check-in result (success/fail)</li>
  <li>Optional reflections (text)</li>
</ul>
<p>This content is stored locally on your device using Apple’s on-device storage. Loop Killer does not upload or sync your entries to our servers.</p>

<h3>Anonymous Analytics (TelemetryDeck)</h3>
<p>Loop Killer uses TelemetryDeck to collect anonymous usage analytics to improve reliability and usability. Analytics may include events such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>App opens and screen views</li>
  <li>Feature usage (setting a loop, setting an interrupt, submitting a verdict, viewing reports)</li>
  <li>Settings changes (e.g., notification preferences, check-in time)</li>
  <li>App actions like clearing or exporting data</li>
</ul>
<p>Loop Killer does <strong>not</strong> send the text you type in your daily entries to TelemetryDeck. Analytics events include only event names and limited non-personal properties (for example: success/fail).</p>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your name, email address, phone number, or other contact information. We do <strong>not</strong> collect the advertising identifier (IDFA). We do <strong>not</strong> use analytics for advertising and we do <strong>not</strong> track you across other companies’ apps or websites.</p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>If you enable notifications, Loop Killer schedules local notifications on your device (for example, a morning reminder and an evening check-in reminder). Notifications are generated locally on your device. You can disable notifications at any time in the app or in iOS Settings.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>Loop Killer shares anonymous analytics event data with TelemetryDeck (our analytics provider). We do not share your daily entry text, and we do not share data with advertisers.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>Your entries are stored locally on your device. You can clear your data from within the app. If you export your data, the exported file is shared using iOS’s standard share options and you control where it goes.</p>

<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delete data:</strong> You can clear all app data from Settings or by uninstalling the app.</li>
  <li><strong>Export data:</strong> You can export your data as a JSON file from Settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Analytics are enabled by default to help improve the app. We do not currently offer an in-app opt-out.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can enable/disable notifications in the app or iOS Settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted on this page.</p>
